All C++ Programs require C++20 

In order to get the version C++ 20, you insert `-std=c++20` or `-std=gnu++c20` option on the command line arguments (GCC). 

Since April 2021, I've replaced my compiler with new version to get C++ 20 support

You may also need 2 DLL's to run the executable file properly or I will use static library.
